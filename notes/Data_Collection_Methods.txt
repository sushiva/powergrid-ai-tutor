What's Next - Phase 2 Options:
According to your roadmap, Phase 2 covers:
Option A: Data Collection (Chapters 6-10)
Collect more PDFs (ArXiv papers, IEEE, NREL)
Build data collection scripts
Expand knowledge base to 100+ documents
Better metadata extraction
Option B: Advanced RAG (Chapters 16-20)
Implement hybrid search (BM25 + semantic)
Add reranking with Cohere
Query routing
Improve retrieval quality



Phase 2: Data Collection Methods
You'll use various tools to gather electrical engineering content:
1. ArXiv API
Search for renewable energy papers
Download PDFs automatically
Already have arxiv library installed
2. Web Scraping
BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML
Scrape educational sites, documentation
Extract clean text from web pages
3. Perplexity/Web Search APIs
Use Perplexity API to find relevant sources
Or web search to discover papers/articles
Curate high-quality content
4. Manual Collection
Download IEEE papers (if you have access)
NREL reports
Technical standards
Open textbooks
The Goal:
Collect 50-100 documents about:
Solar energy systems
Power grid technology
Renewable energy
Electrical engineering fundamentals
This gives your RAG system real knowledge to work with.


Understanding the Numbers:
852 Documents
This is NOT 50 PDFs. Here's why:
You have 50 PDF files
Each PDF has multiple pages
Each page becomes one "document" in the system
852 = total number of pages across all 50 PDFs
Example:
Paper 1: 10 pages → 10 documents
Paper 2: 15 pages → 15 documents
Paper 3: 8 pages → 8 documents
...and so on
852 total pages from your 50 PDF files

2166 Chunks
After loading the 852 pages, the chunker splits them into smaller pieces:
Each page contains multiple paragraphs/sections
Chunker splits each page into smaller 512-token chunks
852 pages → 2166 chunks (about 2.5 chunks per page on average)
Why chunks?
Better retrieval precision
Matches specific parts of documents
Fits within LLM context limits
Simple Summary:
50 PDFs
  ↓ (each PDF has ~17 pages on average)
852 Pages (documents)
  ↓ (each page split into ~2.5 chunks)
2166 Chunks (what gets embedded and searched)
Your RAG system now searches across 2166 chunks from 50 research papers about electrical engineering! Does this make sense now?
